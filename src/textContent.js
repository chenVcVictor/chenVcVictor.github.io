  "Hey! My name is Victor Chen and I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science. Last summer I was a Software Engineer Intern at Emotewell, where I worked on backend features related to user image uploads, improving website security and efficiency. Currently, I am learning full-stack development with a Javascript React frontend and Python Django backend. \n\nOutside of academics, I really enjoy hiking, photography, and playing a variety of mobile/PC games during my free time. That being said, feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I'm open to chat!ðŸ¤—";
